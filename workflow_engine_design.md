# Laravel Workflow Management System - Workflow Engine Design

## Overview

This document provides a detailed design for the workflow engine that powers the approval processes for leave and mission requests in the Laravel Workflow Management System.

## Core Concepts

### Workflow

A workflow is a predefined sequence of approval steps that a request must go through. Each workflow is associated with a specific department and request type (leave or mission).

### Workflow Step

A workflow step represents a single approval stage in the workflow. Each step is assigned to a specific role, and optionally to a specific user. Steps are ordered by step numbers.

### Approval

An approval represents the decision made by an approver at a specific workflow step for a specific request. Approvals can be pending, approved, or rejected.

### Request

A request is an instance of a leave or mission request that follows a specific workflow. The request tracks its current position in the workflow and maintains a history of approvals.

## Workflow Engine Components

### 1. Workflow Manager

The central component that orchestrates the workflow execution process.

Key Responsibilities:

-   Initialize workflows for new requests
-   Process approval decisions
-   Move requests between workflow steps
-   Handle workflow completion
-   Manage workflow exceptions

### 2. Step Processor

Handles the execution logic for individual workflow steps.

Key Responsibilities:

-   Identify the approver(s) for a step
-   Notify approvers of pending approvals
-   Handle step transitions
-   Validate step completion criteria

### 3. Approval Handler

Manages the approval process for individual requests.

Key Responsibilities:

-   Record approval decisions
-   Validate approver permissions
-   Update request status
-   Trigger next step or workflow completion

### 4. Notification Service

Sends notifications at various points in the workflow process.

Key Responsibilities:

-   Notify requesters of status changes
-   Notify approvers of pending approvals
-   Send completion notifications
-   Handle notification preferences

## Workflow Execution Flow

### Request Submission

1. User submits a request (leave or mission)
2. System validates request data
3. Appropriate workflow is selected based on:
    - Request type (leave/mission)
    - User's department
4. Workflow is initialized:
    - Request status set to "pending"
    - Current step set to first workflow step
    - Initial approval records created
5. Notifications sent to:
    - Requester (confirmation)
    - First approver(s)

### Approval Process

1. Approver accesses pending approvals
2. Approver reviews request details
3. Approver makes decision (approve/reject)
4. System validates approver permissions
5. Approval is recorded in database
6. Based on decision:
    - Approved: Move to next step or complete workflow
    - Rejected: End workflow with rejection status
7. Notifications sent to:
    - Requester (status update)
    - Next approver(s) if applicable

### Workflow Completion

1. All workflow steps completed successfully:
    - Request status set to "approved"
    - Completion notifications sent
2. Request rejected at any step:
    - Request status set to "rejected"
    - Rejection notifications sent
    - Workflow terminated

### Database Relationships

#### Workflow Model

```php
class Workflow extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'name',
        'department_id',
        'type',
        'description',
        'is_active'
    ];

    public function department()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Department::class);
    }

    public function steps()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(WorkflowStep::class)->orderBy('step_number');
    }

    public function requests()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Request::class);
    }
}
```

#### WorkflowStep Model

```php
class WorkflowStep extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'workflow_id',
        'step_number',
        'role_id',
        'approver_id',
        'description',
        'is_active'
    ];

    public function workflow()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Workflow::class);
    }

    public function role()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Role::class);
    }

    public function approver()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'approver_id');
    }

    public function approvals()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Approval::class);
    }
}
```

#### Approval Model

```php
class Approval extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'request_id',
        'approver_id',
        'step_id',
        'status',
        'comments',
        'approved_at'
    ];

    protected $casts = [
        'approved_at' => 'datetime'
    ];

    public function request()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Request::class);
    }

    public function approver()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    public function step()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(WorkflowStep::class);
    }
}
```

## Exception Handling

### Workflow Exceptions

1. Invalid workflow assignment
2. Missing approvers
3. Circular workflow definitions
4. Inactive workflow/steps
5. Concurrent approval conflicts

### Error Recovery

1. Automatic rollback for failed steps
2. Manual intervention for critical errors
3. Audit logging for all workflow events
4. Notification of system administrators for failures

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

1. Cache active workflows by department and type
2. Cache workflow steps for frequently used workflows
3. Cache user role assignments
4. Cache department hierarchies

### Database Optimization

1. Indexes on frequently queried columns
2. Eager loading of workflow relationships
3. Query optimization for approval dashboards
4. Pagination for large result sets

### Queue Processing

1. Background processing for notifications
2. Async processing for file uploads
3. Batch processing for reports
4. Scheduled tasks for cleanup operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. Workflow initialization logic
2. Step transition rules
3. Approval validation
4. Notification triggers

### Integration Tests

1. Complete workflow execution
2. Department-specific routing
3. Role-based access control
4. Exception handling scenarios

### Performance Tests

1. Workflow execution under load
2. Database query performance
3. Notification delivery times
4. Concurrent approval processing
